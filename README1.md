# Professional Readme

## Description

-  In today's busy era, nobody have time to create a readme file. So this gave me an idea to create an application which will create the readme file for you.

- To achieve my goal, I created this application. In this application you can type in the contents, and it will type those contents in the professional readme template for you.

- It will make the hectic life of today's human a bit easy. Thus giving them a siegh of relief, as they do not have to worry about making a professional readme file anymore.

-Java script and Jquery were totally new to me, so I learned them and used them in a way which enhances my understanding of them.
